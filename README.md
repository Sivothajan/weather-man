### Description

**The Weather Man** is an IoT-based smart weather monitoring system that collects, processes, and displays real-time environmental data. It uses a suite of sensors to measure temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall, transmitting data to a cloud platform for storage and analysis. The system features a web application for remote monitoring and is designed for future AI integration to provide advanced insights. Its modular hardware and software architecture make it ideal for educational, agricultural, and research applications.
